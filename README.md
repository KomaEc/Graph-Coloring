# Small-scale-Graph-Coloring-via-Constraint-Programming
Constraint programming approach to solve small scale graph coloring problem. An inefficient version of AllDifferent Constraint propagation is implemented (find maximum matching using Hungarian algorithm, and find strongly connected component using Kosaraju algorithm, for simplicity). The code is ugly, just for practice.
